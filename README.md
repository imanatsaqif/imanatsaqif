## About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a background in **machine learning**, **React development**, and **Firebase-based systems**. My journey blends technical problem-solving with a storyteller’s heart—shaped by years of creating content, directing, and editing videos. I thrive at the intersection of **clean code** and **clean design**.

Currently, I work remotely as a **Website Developer at RuangHalal.id**, building efficient, accessible, and scalable web solutions.
